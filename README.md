# Reign of Winter

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert RoW to Pathfinder 2E.

The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.

## Conversion roadmap

Conversion can be broken down into several different processes that can be done concurrently.

- Categorize each monster as needing conversion or already officially converted.
-- Create NPCs according to the 2e monster building rules.  Do not use PCs as NPCs.
- Convert unique items, or locate a 2e equivalent.
- Convert DCs.
- Balance encounters using 2e encounter building rules.
- Ensure enough XP is given out to allow for non milestone leveling.
