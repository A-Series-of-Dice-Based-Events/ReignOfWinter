While this process is lengthy, itâ€™s also unobtrusive and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC 5 flat check or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a similar caliber."},{"id":"_aosnyzyj06w","name":"Ice Step","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"offense","description":"A winter-touched jinkin ignores difficult terrain caused by snow or ice, and treats greater difficult terrain caused by ice and snow  as normal difficult terrain."},{"id":"_20sgsch3mdh","name":"Snow Blending","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"offense","description":"A winter-touched jinkin recieves a +4 circumstance bonus to Sneak or Hide in snowy environments."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"n","size":"tiny","type":"fey","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"shortsword","spellattack":{"value":"9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"17","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"30","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Primal","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","","prestidigitation, ray of frost"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":-2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":0,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+7","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":"+7 traps"},"deception":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"17","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"19","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"cold 2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"cold iron 2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_awy4lq8neo8","name":"Shortsword","traits":"agile, finesse, magical, versatile s","attack":"9","damage":"1d6-2 piercing","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"undercommon, common"}
