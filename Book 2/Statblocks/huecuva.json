If a creature interacts directly with a huecuva, it can attempt a DC 21 Will save to see through the illusion. Regardless, the huecuvaâ€™s scent never changes, it always exudes a faint stench of grave dust and decay. Creatures with scent as an imprecise sense recieve a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks or DCs related to this disguise.
