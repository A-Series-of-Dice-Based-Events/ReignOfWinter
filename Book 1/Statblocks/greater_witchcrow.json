This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a teleportation circle, except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical."}],"morespells":[{"id":"_2qbu75kvyeq","name":"Hexes","note":"","spellattack":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"+17","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spells":["","","","","","","","","","cackle, stumbling curse","evil eye"],"constant":"","focuspoints":2,"cantriplevel":""}],"alignment":"cn","size":"tiny","type":"beast","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":17,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"20, fly 50","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Innate Occult","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","invisibility","ventriloquism, ill omen","detect magic"],"constant":"speak with animals (birds only)","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"-1","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"high","note":""},"constitution":{"value":1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"acrobatics":{"value":"+10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"+7","benchmark":"low","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"+10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"+10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":18,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"42","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"+6","benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"+6","benchmark":"low","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"cold 6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_2b5u925ewk2","name":"Claws","traits":"agile, finesse, unarmed","attack":"+8","damage":"1d4+7 slashing","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"common, aklo, speak with birds"}
