The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on disarm attempts. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with an unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir, must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin is Clumsy 1 until they or an ally spends an action to scrape or clear the resin from them. Any enemy grabbed by a frost fir takes a -1 penalty on attempts to escape. Any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes clumsy condition."},{"id":"_5e8x85e0tl","name":"Snag Weapon","traits":"","range":"","actions":"reaction","type":"defense","description":"Trigger The frost fir is damaged by an attack from a weapon; Effect The frost fir makes a Disarm attempt against the triggering weapon."},{"id":"_1v8n163msow","name":"Freeze","traits":"stance","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"The frost fir holds perfectly still.
