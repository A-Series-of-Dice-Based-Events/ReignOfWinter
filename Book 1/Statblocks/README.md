# NPC and Monster Statblocks
Using http://monster.pf2.tools/ you can import/export and share JSON files for your custom made creatures. Please share those JSON files here along with the PNG and PDF file downloaded from the monster builder tool.

The PDF and PNG files should be linked in the Book README.md file, for example (remove the space between the square and round brackets to use)

![Arctic Tatzlwyrm PDF] (./Statblocks/arctic_tatzlewyrm.pdf)
![Arctic Tatzlwyrm PNG] (./Statblocks/arctic_tatzlewyrm.png)

Please remove the number from the end of the filenames downloaded from monster builder so that updates to the monsters do not require an update to the Book README file.

Explain the key thinking and design decisions for each creature in here

Where multiple options for a single monster exists explain the differences below.

## Monster Builds

### Arctic Tatzlewyrm
